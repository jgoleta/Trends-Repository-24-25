		<p align="justify"><strong>Join us as we explore the streets, tracks, and meetups to spot legendary JDM cars in their natural habitat. Get to know the 		specs behind each iconic car while sharing the thrill of spotting them! Our hobby isn't simply about spotting these legendary JDM cars. We also study 		their culture, their importance, as well as their specifications. We study how they are made and how they impacted the car industry. <br><br> This 		hobby is something our group shares and have strong interests on. During our childhood, we've watched movies such as "Fast and the Furious" and played 		racing games. Our childhood is the reason why we got into the hobby of car spotting. <br><br> Again, join us as we study and admire the japanese car 		culture!</p></strong>

Supra: Meaning 			“Transcending” or “Above” in latin, and a rather fitting name for a car which is so much higher than the rest. The Toyota Supra MK4 started production 		in 1993 in Japan.</p></strong>
		<p align="justify"><strong>The Toyota Supra MK4 is equipped with a twin-turbo 3.0-litre straight-six engine, producing up to 320 hp and around 440 Nm 		of torque, known as the 2JZ-series.

Its highest-level performance model "GT-R" was released in 1999. "V⋅spec" was the center of talks due 		to higher traveling performance achieved by exclusive aero parts, specifically tuned suspensions and active LSD, and styling like a racing car.

		The Toyota AE86, often referred to simply as the “Hachi-Roku,” is one of the most beloved and iconic vehicles in automotive history. With its 			lightweight design, rear-wheel-drive layout, and impressive handling capabilities, it quickly became a symbol of the golden era of Japanese sports 		cars. Although the AE86 was produced for only a few years in the mid-1980s, its legacy continues to influence car enthusiasts and motorsport 			enthusiasts alike. This article delves into the Toyota AE86’s history, performance, design, and cultural impact, showcasing why it remains an iconic 		figure even decades after its release.</p></strong><br>

		In 2003, the Japanese automobile manufacturer Mitsubishi introduced their quickest and most advanced Evolution. The car was known as the Lancer 		Evolution VIII and came equipped with cutting-edge technology such as Super Active Yaw Control (AYC).<br> Its performance was even more impressive than 		its predecessor, the Lancer Evolution VII. The enhanced performance primarily came from the AYC and other electrical components controlling the power 		distribution to all four wheels.

		<p align="justify"><strong>
		The introduction of the first turbocharged rotary engine in the Luce/Cosmo, a similar, also fuel injected and non-intercooled 12A turbocharged engine 		was made available for the top-end model of the Series 3 RX-7 in Japan. It was introduced in September 1983.The engine was rated at 165 PS (121 kW) 		(JIS) at 6,500 rpm. <br><br>
		While the peak power figures were only slightly higher than those of the engine used in the Luce/Cosmo, the new "Impact Turbo" was 				developed specifically to deal with the different exhaust gas characteristics of a rotary engine. Both rotor vanes of the turbine were remodeled and 		made smaller, and the turbine had a twenty percent higher speed than a turbo intended for a conventional engine.The Savanna Turbo was short-lived, as 		the next generation of the RX-7 was about to be introduced.

		<p align="justify"><strong>
		Long considered forbidden fruit in the U.S., the Honda Civic Type R made its officially sanctioned stateside debut for the 2017 model year. Since then, 		it's remained one of the most desirable cars among spirited drivers for its blend of performance and drivability. The current-gen Civic Type R debuted 		in 2023 with slightly less dramatic styling and cropped aerodynamic plumage, but with an eager turbo four under the hood churning 315 horsepower 		through a six-speed manual we paid little notice. <br><br>Still a track-day toy with hellacious grip, it slips into daily driver duty effortlessly, 		fulfilling the single-car objective for enthusiasts at a competitive price, putting it squarely on our 2025 10Best list. It competes against the even 		more feral Toyota GR Corolla both aimed squarely at the elder statesmen of the segment the VW Golf R. All three approach the uncomfortable 			$50,000 mark, but considering the cost of infusing a standard Civic with Type R performance hardware, well, perhaps the Type R is a bargain 			in disguise. As one of our favorites in its segment, the Honda Civic Type R has also earned a spot on our Editors’ Choice list for 2025.
